class Kinematic:
	'''
		This class allows resolving direct and inverse kinematic problems with any complexity. 
		It is not meant to be a data format for kinematic, since the whole kinematic definition holds in joints. This class builds appropriate internal data structures on instanciation so that calls to `solve()` are fast and reproducible.
		Realtime (meaning fixed time resolution) is not a target, but reliability and convenience to compute any sort of mechanical interactions between solids.
		
		A kinematic is defined by its joints:
			- each joint works using position variables, the list of all joint positions is called the `state` of the kinematic
			- each joint is a link between 2 solids (start, stop)
			- each joint can provide a transformation matrix from its start solid to stop solid deduced from the joint position, as well as a gradient of this matrix
			
		A kinematic problem is defined by
			- the joints we fix (or solids we fix, but fixing a solid can be done using a joint)
			- the joints who stay free, whose positions need to be deduced from the fixed joints
		
		A list of joints can be seen as a graph of links between solids. The complexity of the kinematic probleme depends on
		
			- the number cycles
			- the degree of freedom
		
		Example:
			
			>>> # keep few joints apart, so we can use them as dict keys, for calling `solve`
			>>> motor1 = Revolute((0,2), Axis(...))
			>>> motor2 = Revolute((0,7), Axis(...))
			>>> free = Free((7,4))
			>>> # the kinematic solver object
			>>> kinematic = Kinematic([
			... 	Revolute((0,1), Axis(...)),
			... 	motor1,
			... 	motor2,
			... 	Planar((7,3), ...),
			... 	Cylindrical((1,3), ...),
			... 	Ball((3,2), ...),
			... 	Prismatic((4,3), ...),
			... 	Planar((1,5), ...),
			... 	Planar((1,6), ...),
			... 	Weld((7,5), mat4(...)),
			... 	Weld((7,6), mat4(...)),
			... 	free,
			... 	], ground=7)
			
			defines a kinematic with the following graph
		
			.. image::
				/schemes/kinematic-kinematic.svg
				
			one can also define a kinematic with notions of direct and inverse transformations.
			The notion of direct and inverse is based on an input/output relation that we define as such: 
			
			- inputs is selection of joint coordinates
			- outputs is a selection of solids poses
			
			>>> kinematic = Kinematic([
			... 	Revolute((0,1), Axis(...)),
			... 	Planar((7,3), ...),
			... 	Cylindrical((1,3), ...),
			... 	Ball((3,2), ...),
			... 	Prismatic((4,3), ...),
			... 	Planar((1,5), ...),
			... 	Planar((1,6), ...),
			... 	Weld((7,5), mat4(...)),
			... 	Weld((7,6), mat4(...)),
			...	],
			...	ground = 7,
			...	inputs = [motor1, motor2],
			...	outputs = [4,5,6],
			...	)
		
		.. tip::
			If your kinematic is a chain of joints, then prefer using `Chain` to reduce the overhead of the genericity.
